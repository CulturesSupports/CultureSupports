### GitHub Actions Overview

GitHub Actions allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows directly in your repository. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow. For more detailed information, visit the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

#### Key Features of GitHub Actions:
- **Workflow Automation**: Automate tasks throughout the software development lifecycle.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Create custom CI workflows directly in your GitHub repository.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Control deployments with features like environments and concurrency.
- **Custom Actions**: Create and share custom actions to perform specific jobs.
- **GitHub Marketplace**: Access tools to improve your workflow.

#### Example Workflow File
Here's an example of a simple GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Run a one-line script
      run: echo Hello, world!
    - name: Run a multi-line script
      run: |
        echo Add other actions to build,
        echo test, and deploy your project.
```
